## Overview

In **43 Monkeys**, players begin as a single experimental monkey breaking out of
a high-security laboratory. As the game progresses, players explore
procedurally-curated floors, liberate other genetically-enhanced monkeys with
unique abilities, and battle scientists, mutants, and facility defenses.

The gameplay combines real-time combat, permadeath, and squad management in a
linear progression of themed environments. Each run presents meaningful
decisions about resource allocation, team composition, and risk-reward
trade-offs.
